# üå± Reduce CO2 Today ‚Äì Information Systems Project
 
This is a full-stack web application built to TODO.
 
The documentation describes browser-based functionality for user interaction and background notifications, as well as server-side routing and data processing.

## üìÅ Project Structure
 
### üî∏ **Browser Side (Client)**
 
Located in the `public/` folder. These scripts run in the user's browser and handle user interactions, push notifications, and UI logic.
 
```
public/
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ js/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ chart.js                     # visualizes data recieved from the ReduceCO2-API
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main2.js                     # Main frontend logic
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ mapScript.js                 # Manages map-related functionality
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ navScript.js                 # Controls navigation UI
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ subscription.js              # Manages user to the ReduceCO2-API
```
 
> ‚úÖ These scripts are **loaded in the browser** and use browser-only APIs like `localStorage`, `navigator.serviceWorker`, and `Notification`.
 
---
 
### üîπ **Server Side (Node.js / Express)**
 
Handles all backend logic, including routing, user authentication, database access, and Firebase Admin SDK functionality.
 
```
routes/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ auth.routes.js                  # Authentication routes
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ subscribe.routes.js             # ReduceCO2-API subscription logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ api.routes.js                   # Other domain-specific routes
...
 
app.js                              # Main Express application configuration
server.js                           # Entry point that starts the Express server
```
 
> ‚ùå These files run in **Node.js**, not in the browser. They **cannot use browser APIs** (like `localStorage`, `window`, or `navigator`).

## üí™ Technologies Used
 
* **Frontend:**
 
  * HTML/CSS + Tailwind
  * JavaScript (Browser APIs)
  * Firebase JS SDK (`firebase-messaging.js`)
  * Service Workers for background notifications
 
* **Backend:**
 
  * Node.js + Express
  * MongoDB + Mongoose
  * Firebase Admin SDK (for server-side FCM logic)

## ‚úÖ Family and Friends Use Case
 
1. User visits the site and allows push notifications.
2. The browser registers a service worker and retrieves an FCM token using `firebase-messaging.js`.
3. The token is stored in `localStorage` and optionally sent to the server to subscribe the user to a topic (like `Monetary`, `Environmental`, etc.).
4. The server uses the Admin SDK to subscribe the token to the topic.
5. The user receives targeted push notifications based on their subscription.

üìÇ Environment Variables
 
This project uses environment variables stored in a .env file. Create one at the root of your project with the following keys:
 
MONGODB_URI="mongodb+srv://USERNAME:PASSWORD@infsystems.xuftu5t.mongodb.net/infsystems"
SESSION_SECRET="SESSION_SECRET"
GMAIL_PWD="GMAIL_PWD"
 
To get assess to MONGODB and GOOGLE Cloud get in touch with the Repo owner
 
‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Never commit your .env file to version control (add it to .gitignore).
